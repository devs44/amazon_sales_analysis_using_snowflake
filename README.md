Amazon Sales data analysis using Snowflake

This project explore an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data flow using the powerful combination of Snowpark and Snowflake. Our focus is on efficiently handling Amazonâ€™s mobile sales order data from three region (India/USA/France) , starting from its loading stage from a local machine to a Snowflake internal stage. We then dive into the crucial process of data curation using Snowpark Data Frame API, where we transform and cleanse the data to ensure its quality and accuracy. Finally, we explore the concept of dimensional modelling, a popular approach for organising data into meaningful structures that facilitate analytical querying and reporting.
